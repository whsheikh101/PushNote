<h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
<p>The App including patents, copyrights, logos, trademarks and trade secrets are legally owned by us or third parties. These rights apply inter alia to the computer code of the App, graphical design, products, company names, etc. All contents of the App are protected by copyright and trademark rights, except as specifically permitted herein.</p>

<h5>License</h5>

<p>Upon your decision to use the App and subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license, without the right to sublicense, for you to install, access and use the App solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes. We reserve all rights in the App not expressly granted to you hereunder.</p>

<h5>Disclaimer</h5>
<p>The App, Services, and other material available through the App are provided "As Is", "at Your Own Risk" and "As Available" without any warranties whatsoever, express or implied. We assume no responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the Services or other material on the App.</p>

<p>All other warranties, express or implied, including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property are specifically excluded and disclaimed. We do not warrant that the Services will meet User's requirements and that the operation of the Services will be uninterrupted or error free, or that the App or the server that makes them available are free of viruses or bugs. We make no warranty regarding the quality of any products, service, information or content obtained through the App or Services or the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any content obtained through the App or Services.</p>

<h5>Limitation of Liability</h5>
<p>We, our affiliates, directors, employees, agents, representatives and third party service providers, will not be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, those resulting from lost profits, lost savings, lost data, business interruption or other special, consequential or incidental damages) arising out of or relating to the use, inability to use, or the results of use of the App, whether based on warranty, contract, tort or any other legal theory and whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of such loss or damages.
In no event will our aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or from the use of or inability to use the App or Services exceed the amount you have paid us during the ninety (90) days prior to your claim (if any). The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between us and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.</p>

<h5>Indemnification</h5>
<p>You agree to indemnify us and our affiliates, directors, employees, agents, representatives and third party service providers, and to defend and hold us and each of them harmless, from any and all claims, actions, liabilities, damages, losses, expenses and costs (including attorney's fees) (collectively, “Claims”) which may arise from your access to or use of the App, Services or information obtained through use of the App, any content that you submit to this App and/or your breach of this Agreement. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive control of any such defense of any such Claim.</p>

<h5>App Availability</h5>
<p>We shall not be responsible for any disruption to the App, regardless of length. We will not be liable for losses related to User's inability to access content due to disruptions of the App. We shall be excused from performance of any obligations under this Agreement which are prevented or interfered due to acts or conditions beyond our reasonable control.</p>

<h5>The Security of the App</h5>
<p>We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards and personnel policies, consistent with applicable laws that are designed to guard the Services, the App and our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your information, we will reasonably attempt to notify you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using your most current email address on record with us.</p>

<p>The User understands and agrees that, in addition to money damages, we shall be entitled to equitable relief where appropriate upon User's breach of any portion of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Any claim relating to the App or use of the App will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without reference to its conflict-of-laws principles. Any dispute arising out of or related to your use of the App will be brought in, and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in, the competent courts in the district of Hartford,Ct. You hereby agree to waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens and agree that process may be served in a manner authorized by applicable law or court rule. If any term or provision of this legal notice is for any reason held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other term or provision, and this legal notice shall be interpreted as if such term or provision had never been contained in this legal notice.</p>

<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
<p>User agrees that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between User and us as a result of this Agreement and/or User's use of the App. User may not assign any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent.
